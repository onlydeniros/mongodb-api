# mongodb-api
The challenge is to build the back end using Mongo-DB and Express.js.


## Description
This app is strictly backend. Express.js was used for the server and MongoDB for the database along with Mongoose.
The Mongo database includes tables for users, thoughts, friends, and reaction schema's to replicate the functionality of a social media post. RESTful API routes are used to make requests and updates from the database which are joined through Mongoose queries allowing the ability to "CRUD" the database. 


## Technology Used
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- NoSQL
- Npm packages
